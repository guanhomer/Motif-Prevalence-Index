# Motif-Prevalence-Index
Code for the study, "The borders of cis-regulatory regions harbor the divergent transcription factor binding motifs in the human genome" (2018).

Here, we firstly proposed a novel measurement, Motif Prevalence Index (MPI), to estimate the evolutionary divergence level of TF binding specificities in human. Based on the phylogenetic distance and the existence of a given motif (i.e. having homologous TFs with conserved amino acid sequences of DBD from the Cis-BP database) across metazoan species, MPI represents the divergence level of the human motif in evolution with a score from 0 (human-specific) to 1(common in 74 metazoan species).
